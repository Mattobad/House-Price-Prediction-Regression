### House price prediction 

Code used for publishing the model in pythonAnywhere. For simplicity, I've removed the all the code for training the model(pipeline).
Repository consists of frontend code in front-end module and ml_api module consists of code for flask-api and saved model.

If you want to reproduce the project, you can use requirements text file to setup a conda environment.
