### House price prediction 

Initially, the repo was started as House Regression prediction submission containing experimental jupyter notebooks which 
can be found in the jupyter_notebooks submodule.
- [Model buidling without Feature Selection Technique: Base Model](https://github.com/Mattobad/House-Price-Prediction-Regression/blob/master/jupyter_notebooks/End-to-End-Housing-Price-Prediction-without-feature-selection.ipynb)
- [Model buidling with Feature Selection Technique](https://github.com/Mattobad/House-Price-Prediction-Regression/blob/master/jupyter_notebooks/End-to-End%20ML%20project%20with%20Feature%20Selection%20techniques.ipynb)

Now, expanding the repo with following steps for deploying the model in production:

:white_check_mark: Exploratory Analysis(Feature Engineering, Feature Selection, Hyperparameter optimization, Model development)

:white_check_mark: Building Machine Learning Pipeline(Scikit-learn pipeline Architecture)

:white_check_mark: Model API development(Serving model through RESTful API)

:white_check_mark: Deploying to production(Web App)
